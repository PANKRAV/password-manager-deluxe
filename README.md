<h3 style="color:red;">PASSWORD MANAGER</h3>

I'm revamping my password manager repository to make it :
* **_faster_** 
* **_cleaner_** and 
* (I hope) **_safer_**.
  
I'm done with this repository for sometime if someone wants to contribute maybe make the user reset processes run through a thread in the background or maybe exchange every mention of os.system() with the subprocess module and issue a pull request.
<br>
<br>
Anyways, thanks for viewing my repository and for any contributions!



P.S
For the original version of the project with _sadly less readable code_, for now, [see](https://github.com/PANKRAV/password-manager):
